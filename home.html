      <h1>Welcome to PhotoBooth</h1>
      <p>
        PhotoBooth is a space where moments are captured exactly as they are;
        raw, timeless, and full of feeling. From quiet details to bold memories,
        each photograph tells a story worth keeping. Step in, explore, and let
        the moments speak for themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        PhotoBooth is all about catching the moments that actually matter; the
        laughs, the side-eyes, the chaos, and the vibes. No stiff poses, no fake
        smiles, just real energy and memories you’ll want to flex forever.
        Scroll around, stay a bit, and let’s make some main-character moments.

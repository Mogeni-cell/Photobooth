        This is where the proof lives. Every shot here is unfiltered energy real
        moments, real people, real stories. No over-posing, no forcing the vibe.
        Just light, angles, and timing doing what they do best.

        I shoot for the moments you don’t plan the laugh mid-blink, the look
        away from the camera, the calm before the chaos. Each photo is a
        freeze-frame of a feeling, captured the way it was meant to be
        remembered. Scroll through, take your time, and if something makes you
        feel seen… yeah, that was intentional
